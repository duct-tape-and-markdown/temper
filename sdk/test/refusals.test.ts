/**
 * Declare-side emit refusals — a broken source yields no output, never silent
 * bytes.
 * The compile catches a `satisfies` claim that names no declared requirement (a
 * dangling join) before it writes a byte. It does **not** gate fill: whether
 * every `required` requirement has a satisfier is the engine's requirement
 * clause, which sees a layout host's edge-slot fills the SDK never reads — a
 * required requirement with no composed satisfier must not refuse SDK-side, or a
 * layout-fill corpus would refuse spuriously. A clean harness emits without
 * throwing.
 *
 * Mention refusals live in emit.test.ts ("an unresolved mention is a loud emit
 * error"); this file owns only the declare-side cases.
