//! The harness is a graph: skills and rules pointing at each other through
//! **declared** reference fields, read off [`Features`], never grepped from a body
//! (`specs/10-contracts.md`, the referential primitive). Nodes are `(kind, id)`
//! across every kind; edges are the [`Edge`] relationships declared on the surface.
//! Four checks range over it: [`check`] (route resolution — a reference resolves to a
//! real target), [`admissibility`] (each edge names its field and a modeled target
//! kind, checked before the graph is trusted), [`acyclic`] (no circular import), and
//! [`degree`] (a satisfier node's in/out count lands in a requirement's bound). All
//! range over one resolved-edge enumeration ([`resolved_edges`]), shared with
//! `crate::read`'s narration so gate and read never disagree (READ-EDGE-UNIFY).
