//! The read family — `why`, `requirements`, and `impact`, read-only traversals over the
//! requirement↔`satisfies` edge and the graph `check` already carries
//! (`specs/architecture/20-surface.md`, "Decision: the CLI gains a read family", and the `impact`
//! CLI bullet).
//!
//! [`why`] walks the edge **forward** (this member → the requirements it fills, with
//! their authored rationale → the package its kind binds → its resolved edges in and
//! out); [`requirements`] walks it in **reverse** (the roster → each requirement's
//! satisfier set + coverage state, and with a name the blast radius a removal would
//! strand); [`impact`] narrates the **blast radius of a removal** — what strands if a
//! member is removed or renamed: the requirements it is the sole satisfier of (left
//! unfilled), the `satisfies` links onto demands it alone publishes (left dangling), the
//! `@import` directive edges that point at it (left unbacked), and the members whose
//! reachability was carried only through it (gone dead). All are *projections* over the
//! data `check` already computes — the
//! opt-in `satisfies` bindings [`crate::coverage`] gates, and, for the edge walk, the
//! **gate's own resolved edge set** ([`crate::graph::resolved_edges`], relationships
//! over extracted features), never a private re-derivation off the `[edge.<target>]`
//! document clauses (READ-EDGE-UNIFY: one source of truth, so `why`'s edge narration
//! cannot disagree with `graph::check`). Neither adds engine semantics and neither ever
//! gates: they return narration, and `main` prints it and exits zero on every input
//! (the read family is not the gate; a reporting verb whose exit code CI trusts is
//! exactly what the Decision rejects).
//!
//! The output is a **teaching surface**, not a table dump (`specs/architecture/50-distribution.md`,
//! "the gate teaches"): full sentences over the author's own artifacts, in the
//! corpus's vocabulary. The narration is derived, never persisted.
//!
//! ## Scope: every opt-in kind, built-in and custom
//!
//! This tier reads the members [`Workspace`] carries — the built-in opt-in kinds
//! (skill ⊕ rule) — **and** the custom-kind members the caller threads in as
//! [`CustomMember`]s (READ-CUSTOM-SATISFIERS): temper's own `spec`s, or any consumer's
//! custom kind whose member fills a requirement. The decidable
//! [`crate::extract::Features`] drops the `satisfies` rationale, so a custom member
//! arrives carrying its rationale-preserving [`crate::document::Satisfies`] clauses
//! ([`crate::kind::Unit::satisfies_clauses`]) instead — the *why* the read family
//! narrates whole. So a custom member filling a requirement is no longer silently
//! absent from either verb; the roster the read family narrates agrees with the gate.
//! Edge narration already ranges over every kind (it reads the gate's resolved edge
//! set, READ-EDGE-UNIFY), so only the `satisfies` walk widens here.
