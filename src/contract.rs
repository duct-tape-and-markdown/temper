//! The `Contract` artifact — the decidable artifact-clause algebra.
//!
//! A [`Contract`] is a named set of [`Clause`]s over a **closed** vocabulary of
//! decidable predicates, each carrying an author-declared [`Severity`]. Every live
//! `Contract` is built from the lock's `ClauseRow` family ([`crate::builtin`],
//! [`crate::compose::default_contract_from_rows`]) — there is no hand-authored clause
//! grammar; the SDK's types are the only authoring spelling.
//!
//! There is no arbitrary-code clause: adding a predicate is a deliberate language
//! change, never a per-contract escape hatch.
