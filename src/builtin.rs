//! The embedded built-in floor projection.
//!
//! Each built-in kind's floor [`Contract`] (`agent`, `command`, `skill`, `rule`,
//! `memory`) is a lossless
//! projection of the embedded built-in lock's clause rows
//! (`crate::builtin_lock::declarations`), grouped by kind label — never a
//! hand-written mirror. The lock
//! itself is `@dtmd/temper/claude-code`'s own emit; this module only lifts its
//! `ClauseRow`s back into the typed [`Contract`] algebra the gate already runs on.
